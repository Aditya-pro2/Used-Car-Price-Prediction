# Used-Car-Price-Prediction

## Introduction

This repository contains the [train](Data/train.csv), [test](Data/test.csv) and [sample submission](Data/sample_submission.csv) files used by the [Regression of Used Car Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e9/overview) competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the [Used Car Price Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taeefnajib/used-car-price-prediction-dataset). Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original.

## Files

- [**train.csv**](Data/train.csv) - The training dataset; `price` is the continuous target.
- [**test.csv**](Data/test.csv) - The test dataset; the objective is to predict the value of `price` for each row.
- [**sample_submission.csv**](Data/sample_submission.csv) - A sample submission file in the correct format.
- [**Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb**](<Used Car Price Prediction.ipynb>) - A notebook containing my approach.
- [**Submission.csv**](Submission.csv) - The submission file generated by the above notebook.

## Dataset Features

- **ID** - The ID numbers of each row.
- **Brand & Model** - Identify the brand or company name along with the specific model of each vehicle.
- **Model Year** - Discover the manufacturing year of the vehicles, crucial for assessing depreciation and technology advancements.
- **Mileage** - Obtain the mileage of each vehicle, a key indicator of wear and tear and potential maintenance requirements.
- **Fuel Type** - Learn about the type of fuel the vehicles run on, whether it's gasoline, diesel, electric, or hybrid.
- **Engine Type** - Understand the engine specifications, shedding light on performance and efficiency.
- **Transmission** - Determine the transmission type, whether automatic, manual, or another variant.
- **Exterior & Interior Colors** - Explore the aesthetic aspects of the vehicles, including exterior and interior color options.
- **Accident History** - Discover whether a vehicle has a prior history of accidents or damage, crucial for informed decision-making.
- **Clean Title** - Evaluate the availability of a clean title, which can impact the vehicle's resale value and legal status.

## Target Variable

- **Price** - Access the listed prices for each vehicle, aiding in price comparison and budgeting.

## Approach

A Neural Network Model using `TensorFlow` and `Keras`. I have used a `Sequential` model with the following architecture: `Input -> Dense -> Batch Normalization -> Dropout -> Dense -> Batch Normalization -> Dropout -> Dense -> Batch Normalization -> Dense`. I have also added 2 callbacks: `Early Stopping` and `Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau`.

## Evaluation Metric

Performance is evaluated using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
